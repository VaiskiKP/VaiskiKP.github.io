<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">There are multiple places where you can find me at but these are the most common ones:
</p>
<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Youtube
</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk5jaUve-yNLCyCm9qDmIZQ>VaiskiMacrocosm</a>
</h4>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This is the channel I currently upload the most to its also the channel where I stream my speedruns. All the content on this  channel has been edited on Davinci Resolve and Audacity.
</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuDn3rht7Beu6Q0zj2lwMyQ>VaiskiKP</a>
</h4>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This is a little bit older channel that I used to upload to and its the best place to find how I edited my older videos. All the content made before 2020 was edited in Lightworks after that in Davinci Resolve.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Twitch
</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href=https://www.twitch.tv/vaiskikp>VaiskiKP (18++)</a>
</h4>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">this is a place where I used to stream. The content was very raw and bloody and stuff so I'd recommend not watching this content at all.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Music
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">I have deleted most of my music because I realised how bad it was. I have however saved on song from it to the VaiskiKP youtube channel. Here is a <a href=https://youtu.be/CMz_9X6Iy0A>Link (18+)</a>.
