<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This is for me to save all of videos (/editing projects) I'm most proud of.

<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica"> VaiskiKP (20.4.2017 - continuing)
</h2>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This  was I think my 4th or 5th channel. This is the channel this was the channel that made me start my earliest editing projects so I keep some of the videos really important.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">(18+)"Bo 2 osa 1 desc!" 16.3.2017 (Edited in PowerDirector free phone version)
</h3>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This is the oldest video I was able to find. This is also the first video I uploaded to my VaiskiKP channel. Even though its recorded with a phone and has bad gameplay its important to me because it was the first edited video I ever published.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica"> (18+) "puhutaan Star Wars- The Last Jedi:stä" 15.12.2017 (Edited in OpenShot)
</h3>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This video was my "Voice reveal". This video was the first commentary type video I ever made and I followed this style of videos for 2-3 years after that while impoving my editing.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica"> (18+) "SUOMEN SEURAAVA TÄHTI RÄPPÄÄJÄ" 12.5.2019 (Edited in LightWorks)
</h3>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This was the video that started the best time on the VaiskiKP channel (Which was 2 weeks). This  was when I was just starting to learn a pc editing program which is the reason it isn't the best but it is a big improvement from "puhutaan Star Wars- The Last Jedi:stä".

</h3>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This was the last commentary video that I uploaded to the VaiskiKP channel. After this video I basically gave up on this channel and just uploaded unedited gameplay of top scores I got on rhythm games until...

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica"> (16+) "[50 sub special] VKPz - VaiskiP" 13.4.2020 (Edited in Davinci Resolve)
</h3>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This is actually my second 50 sub special but the first one was so cringe that I actually deleted it and gave up on making a sub special until a few years later when I had gotten a bunch more editing skill and knowledge and also started working with actual musicians.

</h2>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This is my second newest channel and I try to keep making content for it (even thought this channel was created in 2017 I only started uploading to it in 2019). It was created so I could create LEGO Universe content without having to worry that I couldn't advertise it and so I could  organise where specific kind of videos go.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">"The ToS - LU readings" 28.3.2020 (Edited in Davinci Resolve)

<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This was the first video in a series of videos where I read stuff related to LU. Thats pretty much it there isn't much to it.

</h2>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica">This channels idea was to make a English channel so I could create English content too. Of course that didn't work because my english was horrible and all the videos where either edited on my phone, unedited or edited using the PS4 editor.
