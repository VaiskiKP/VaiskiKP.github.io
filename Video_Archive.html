<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This is for me to save all of the videos (/editing projects) I'm most proud of.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica"> VaiskiKP (20.4.2017 - continuing)
</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This was I think my 4th or 5th channel. This is the channel that made me start my earliest editing projects so I keep some of the videos really important.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">(18+)"Bo 2 osa 1 desc!" 16.3.2017 (Edited in PowerDirector free phone version)
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This is the oldest video I was able to find. This is also the first video I uploaded to my VaiskiKP channel. Even though its recorded with a phone and has bad gameplay its important to me because it was the first edited video I ever published.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica"> (18+) "puhutaan Star Wars- The Last Jedi:stä" 15.12.2017 (Edited in OpenShot)
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This video was my "Voice reveal". This video was the first commentary type video I ever made and I followed this style of videos for 2-3 years while impoving my editing.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica"> (18+) "SUOMEN SEURAAVA TÄHTI RÄPPÄÄJÄ" 12.5.2019 (Edited in LightWorks)
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This was the video that started the best time on the VaiskiKP channel (Which was 2 weeks). This  was when I was just starting to learn a pc editing which is the reason it isn't the best but it is a big improvement from "puhutaan Star Wars- The Last Jedi:stä".

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica"> (16+) "Mä vihaan TÄTÄ mainostaktiikka" 1.12.2019 (Edited in LightWorks)
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This was the last commentary video that I uploaded to the VaiskiKP channel. After this video I basically gave up on this channel and just uploaded unedited gameplay of top scores I got on rhythm games until...

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica"> (16+) "[50 sub special] VKPz - VaiskiP" 13.4.2020 (Edited in Davinci Resolve)
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This is actually my second 50 sub special but the first one was so cringe that I actually deleted it and gave up on making a sub special until a few years later when I had gotten a bunch more editing skill and knowledge and also started working with actual musicians.

<h2 style="font-family:Helvetica"> VaiskiMacrocosm (16.8.2017 - continuing)
</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This is my second newest channel and I try to keep making content for it (even thought this channel was created in 2017 I only started uploading to it in 2019). It was created so I could create LEGO Universe content without having to worry that I couldn't advertise it and so I could  organise where specific kind of videos go.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">"The ToS - LU readings" 28.3.2020 (Edited in Davinci Resolve)
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">This was the first video in a series of videos where I read stuff related to LU. Thats pretty much it there isn't much to it.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">"The EULA - LU readings" 28.3.2020 (Edited in Davinci Resolve)
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">Yeah.... not much to say about this.

<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">"ALUR I - Easter 2020" 11.4.2020 (Edited in Davinci Resolve)
</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;">THIS is one of my biggest editing projects and it was a blast to make. Hopefully if you come back later to this site there will be more of ALUR videos here :).
